What is The RIDE? 
The RIDE paratransit service provides door-to door, shared-ride public transportation using accessible vehicles to eligible people who cannot use fixed-route transit (bus, subway, trolley) all or some of the time because of a physical, cognitive, or mental disability.
The RIDE is operated by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) in compliance with the Federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Under the ADA, paratransit functions as a ‘safety net’ for people whose disabilities prevent them from using public transit. It is not intended to be a comprehensive system of transportation that meets all the needs of persons with disabilities. Public transportation is distinct from medical or human services transportation. As it is a shared-ride service, you may travel with other customers going in the same general direction. ADA travel times are to be comparable to the same trip taken on fixed-route (bus, subway, or trolley) plus an additional 20 minutes.


Where does it serve? : 
The RIDE complements the fixed-route system, operating 365 days a year generally from 5am – 1am in fifty-eight (58) cities and towns. For trips with origin and destination within 3/4 mile of fixed-route service that operates outside of these hours, or in other municipalities within 3/4 miles of MBTA bus service, extended RIDE service is available.


The RIDE serves these cities and towns: Arlington, Bedford, Belmont, Beverly, Boston, Braintree, Brookline, Burlington, Cambridge, Canton, Chelsea, Cohasset, Concord, Danvers, Dedham, Everett, Hingham, Holbrook, Hull, Lexington, Lincoln, Lynn, Lynnfield, Malden, Marblehead, Medfield, Medford, Melrose, Middleton, Milton, Nahant, Needham, Newton, Norwood, Peabody, Quincy, Randolph, Reading, Revere, Salem, Saugus, Sharon, Somerville, Stoneham, Swampscott, Topsfield, Wakefield, Walpole, Waltham, Watertown, Wenham, Weston, Westwood, Weymouth, Wilmington, Winchester, Winthrop, and Woburn. Portions of Abington, Avon, Billerica, Brockton,
Stoughton, and Wellesley are also served. See the end of this guide for a full map.


How much does it cost?:
One-way ADA fare is $3.35 for each registered customer or guest. One-way premium non-ADA fare is $5.60 for each registered customer or guest. Premium non-ADA fares apply if the trip origin and/or destination is greater than 3/4 miles from MBTA bus or subway service or for same-day changes, except for trip time negotiation. Reservationists will confirm the fare when you schedule a trip.
A Personal Care Assistant (PCA) or child under the age of 11 accompanying a customer (up to 2 children per customer) is not charged a fare. Customers may bring one guest, with additional guests allowed if space is available. PCAs and guests must travel to and from the same destination at the same time as the customer. Guests who are not PCAs or children do not ride for free.

after 5pm for travel the following day. Same day requests cannot be accommodated unless using Ride FLEX.


How to book or schedule a RIDE:
 • Request an Arrival Time for trips to a destination where you need to arrive before a specific time (for example, arriving at a doctor’s appointment by 9am) or Pick-Up Time for trips from a destination where you cannot leave earlier than a specific time (for example, leaving work after you are off at 5pm)
• Provide necessary pick-up and drop-off location information, indicate your mobility type, and if you will travel with a PCA, guest(s), child, or Service Animal
• Receive a call the night prior to your trip by 9:00pm with your scheduled pick-up time.
• Please keep in mind the following when booking your trip:
1.  Requested arrival and pick-up times must be at least 45 minutes apart
2. Please be prepared for your vehicle to arrive anytime between 5 minutes before to 15 minutes after your scheduled pick-up time.
3. Ensure you can wait safely at your destination as you may be dropped off up to 30 minutes early and drivers cannot wait until a location opens
4. Always book your trips with extra time should unforeseen delays arise

Reoccurring (Subscription) Trips: Customers may have their trips automatically scheduled if they travel to and from the same locations two or more days per week. Call TRAC to request to schedule a subscription, eliminating the need to call for each trip. Subscription service is subject to availability. 
Please note the following restrictions: 
• Subscription service is not scheduled on holidays; therefore, you are responsible for reserving your trips on those days.
• Any change in your eligibility status or conditions (i.e., from Unconditional to Conditional and vice versa) may interrupt your subscription service
• Two consecutive no-shows for round trip rides will cancel a subscription 
• A lack of funds in your account to cover all booked rides for the next 5 days will cancel your subscription. You will receive a phone call to alert you to add funds prior to your subscription and trips being suspended.


How do I change or cancel a trip?
 You may change trips up until 5pm of the day before service by calling TRAC at 844427-7433. After 5pm, trips for the following day are scheduled and cannot be changed. Please cancel trips as soon as your plans change using the booking website at www.mbta.com/booktheride, or by calling TRAC at 844-427-7433. Customers must adhere to the No-Show/Late Cancellation Policy found in this guide.




How will I be notified about my trip?
 The trip notification process includes two phone messages: 
1. Night before your trip by 9:00pm: A trip confirmation message providing your scheduled pick-up time.
   1. Please be prepared for your vehicle to arrive anytime between 5 minutes before to 15 minutes after your scheduled pick-up time.
2. Day of your trip, 10 minutes before: An arrival notification indicating your driver is almost there. Head to your location’s external-most door.


How can I make my pick-up a success? 
• Be patient while you wait as a driver’s arrival can be delayed by issues out of their control including traffic, customer delays, and inclement weather.
• Please do not contact TRAC for trip status updates unless it is 15 minutes past your scheduled pick-up time and your driver has not arrived.  If you have reached the end of your 15-minute pick-up time and your driver has not arrived, you may check on the status of your trip by calling TRAC at 844-427-7433. Only contact TRAC if your vehicle does not arrive by the end of the pick-up time to obtain their assistance in locating your vehicle.
• At your given pick-up time meet your driver at your location’s external-most door. If you are not there, the driver will obtain clearance from TRAC to leave after waiting 5 minutes.
• Do not leave your pick-up location once you get your 10-minute arrival call. 
• Confirm your name and destination with the driver 
• Call TRAC immediately to rebook your return trip if you are delayed at an appointment. TRAC will do its best to accept your change, but there is no guarantee if availability is limited. The change will incur a premium non-ADA fare


What if I don’t get my preferred pick-up time? 
If, during callbacks the night before a trip, you receive a pick-up time that does not work for you, you may negotiate trip times with TRAC by calling them as soon as possible that evening. Some changes are not considered negotiations and will incur a premium non-ADA fare. These include, but are not limited to, requests less than one hour before a trip, rescheduling a missed trip, rescheduling at least 30 minutes earlier or later than the originally requested time, or changes to pick-up or drop-off locations.


Can I request a specific vehicle or driver?
Requests for preferred type vehicles will not be honored. The Authority’s decision to utilize multiple vehicle types does not conflict with ADA/DOT regulations, which require an accessible vehicle (e.g., lift/ramp equipped) be provided. If you refuse a vehicle upon arrival, which is accessible to you, another one will not be sent.


How long will I be in a vehicle? Do I need to transfer?
Per the ADA, travel time should be comparable to fixed-route (bus, subway, trolley) travel time plus 20 minutes to account for travel to and from the transit stop and transfers. Travel times may increase due to inclement weather, traffic, or diverting to pick up another customer who missed a return pick-up. You can review fixed-route travel times using the MBTA’s Trip Planner at www.mbta.com/trip-planner and can add 20 minutes to approximate estimated travel time.
Trips spanning multiple communities within the MBTA service area, or trips to MetroWest Regional Transit Authority and Brockton Area Transit, may require a transfer trip. TRAC will coordinate travel with these Regional Transit Authorities only if the trip originates in the MBTA service area. You will either remain on your vehicle until the actual transfer to the other vehicle takes place, or if required, be assisted to the receiving agency’s transfer location, and then continue your trip. There is no assistance available at the Brockton Area Transit drop location.
If you need to book a trip which may involve a transfer, please call TRAC at 844-427-
7433. Transfer trips cannot be scheduled through the online booking website.


What if I cancel too late or miss my trip? 
A customer’s trip will be considered as “no-show/late cancel” (NSLC) if the customer is not present within 5 minutes after their scheduled pick-up time, or the customer does not cancel at least one-hour ahead of the start of the pick-up time.
No-show/late cancellations are considered a pattern or practice when a customer reserves 7 or more trips within any month and no-shows or late cancels 20 percent or more of those scheduled trips.
A pattern or practice of no-show or late cancellation trips is a policy violation and will result in written warning and possible suspension. No shows or late cancellations for reasons beyond a customer’s control that are reported to TRAC, or trips which are missed due to operator error, shall not be a basis for determining that a pattern or practice exists resulting in a violation. Prior to sending letters, the MBTA will review all NSLCs to ensure that the process was followed properly, and an accurate count is
represented. Any NSLC that is found to be in error will be removed.
The following actions shall apply to violations that occur within the same 12-month rolling period: 
1. 1st Violation -> Written Warning
2. 2nd Violation -> 1 Week Suspension Period 
3. 3rd Violation -> 2 Week Suspension Period
4. 4th or Subsequent Violations -> 4 Week Suspension Period


Information on how to appeal the suspension, either written or in-person, will be included in notification to customers. Appeals must be postmarked within 30 calendar days of the date on which the notice of suspension was issued. No suspension will take place if a customer has filed an appeal in accordance with the instructions and deadlines noted in the policy and the Appeals Board has not determined the outcome of the appeal. The decision of the Appeals Board is final.

How many packages may I bring onboard?
 If you bring packages (e.g., groceries, luggage), the driver must, in one trip, be able to safely assist you while at the same time carry your items to / from the vehicle. Transportation will not be provided to customers who exceed this policy.
What animals may I bring onboard? 
Only Service Animals as defined by the ADA are allowed. Other animals (i.e., comfort/therapy animals or pets) are NOT allowed. The ADA requires Service Animals to be under the control of the handler at all times. This can occur using a harness, leash, or other tether. If the handler is unable to hold a tether because of a disability or its use would interfere with the Service Animal’s safe, effective performance of work or tasks, the Service Animal must be under the handler’s control by some other means, such as voice control. Service Animals cannot be in a carrier, on a seat, or on a customer’s lap.


How do I travel with children? 
School transportation of minors (Grades K-12) is not provided. Customers must provide and install their personal child car/booster seat. Drivers will assist in carrying the seat to and from the vehicle, but the customer or their PCA must provide and install the car or booster seat in accordance with all federal and state laws. Drivers cannot install or uninstall the seat or place the child in or out of the seat. If a customer’s disability prevents them from fulfilling these responsibilities, the customer should consider traveling with a PCA to provide assistance.
